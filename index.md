  <h1> A Curated Collection of All of the Best Recipes to Grace this Earth</h1>
    <h3>By: S.S.</h3> 

  <p><strong>About Me:</strong> As an avid eater and digester, I have come accross many, many recipes over these long years that I've lived. I do not exaggerate when I say that some of these creations were crafted at the hands of outright monsters and others were blessed by angelic supernatural beings. I have curated a selective list of the latter group, as I believe in the act of sharing the good things in this world, however limited as they may be (the dessert section is my favorite). I entrust you with the blueprints for these magical foodthings and sincerely hope you enjoy making and eating them. Lukewarm regards, S.S.</p>
